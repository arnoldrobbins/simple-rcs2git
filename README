============================

These simple scripts help in converting an RCS collection of files
into a Git repo.  Usage is:

	rlog RCS/* | awk -f rcs2data.awk |
		sort | awk -f data2sh.awk > script
	vim script	# or emacs, we don't discriminate :-)
	git init .
	sh -x script

The reason to edit the script is that you may want to add tags
at certain points along the way.

These scripts are good only for the simple case of a single RCS
directory with no branches, just straight check-ins. Files that
were checked in with a single 'ci' command will be added to git
with a single git commit.

The gendiff.awk script is useful for reconstituting a ChangeLog
after the fact (if you never had one). Usage is:

	git log | awk -f gendiff.awk > OUT

The generated file contains all the diffs between commits, starting
with the most current and going backwards. You can review this and
create a ChangeLog.  This is manual labor, but it need not be too
terrible (we hope! :-).
